    <p>This Indonesian condiment is known as ketjap medja only in the Netherlands. After decades of colonization the Dutch brought it back to their home and gave it a new name. My dad is half Indonesian, half Dutch, so that's the version he's more familiar with. But in Indonesia, sweet soy sauce is called kecap manis.</p>
     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <li>Start with noodles</li>
     <p>Kecap manis is the signature ingredient in mei goreng â€” stir fried noodles, tossed with cabbage, bean sprouts, strips of egg omelet, and sometimes chicken and prawns. You can see how kecap manis could easily dress a simple ramen dish, topped with chopped scallions and a fried egg, or could be tossed into soba noodles.</p>
