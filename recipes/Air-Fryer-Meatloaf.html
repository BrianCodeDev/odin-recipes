    <p>This flavorful air fryer meatloaf recipe is incredibly easy to make, requires simple ingredients, and is ready to eat in just under an hour.</p>
    <ul>

    <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
    <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons dry bread crumbs</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme</li>
    <li>Â¾ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>2 mushrooms, thickly sliced</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed</li>

</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat an air fryer to 392 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Combine ground beef, onion, bread crumbs, thyme, egg, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Knead and mix thoroughly. Transfer mixture to a small loaf pan. Smooth the top, press in mushrooms, and coat with olive oil.</li>
